# Modified-Tower-Defense-Python-Classwork

Sorry, I lost the code! However, this is similar to the breakout game that I have on this github. To any Waterloo Admissions Officers, look at that code, as it shows the same skills that I used for the tower defense game! Sorry for not having code, I didn't realize that I didn't have it until after the AIF deadline passed!
